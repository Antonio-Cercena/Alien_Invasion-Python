Alien_Invasion-Python is a project from the text, "Python Crash Course". 
My intention was to build a game similar to "Space Invaders" in order to learn and practice
Python code and Object Oriented programming.
Completing this project assisted me in understanding how to build classes, methods, importing pygame modules,
and overall learning how methods/functions are called and utilized in displaying the final product.
